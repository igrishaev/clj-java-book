## Summary

So the previous session was the last one on that book. I hope most of you reading this have managed to reach these lines. My praise to them!

It has been a tough material I must confess. So far, we've dug through a lot of Java stuff which is rare in ordinary tutorials. Rather than sorting a vector of integers, I tried to bring the very teste of product development. This is where pure Clojure approach fades a bit. Such code might look completely imperative since it relies on mutable objects and their state. It pushes you reading Java docs a lot and generally it differs to playing with nice Clojure structures. But at least Clojure reduces the pain you suffer from working with other languages.

Getting back to the question from the beginning of a book, let me summarize. No, you don't have to know Java before getting into Clojure. Yes, professional Clojure code relies on Java a lot. But don't be afraid of it. Even going in small steps is reasonable when the road goes uphill. So the Clojure way does.
